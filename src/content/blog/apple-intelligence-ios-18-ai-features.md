## What is Apple Intelligence? Defining the Contextual Leap

Apple Intelligence (**Apple AI**) is the framework of generative models and deep learning features that Apple is weaving into its operating systems. Its core mission is to bridge the gap between powerful generalized AI and your unique, daily life.

The system is built on three central capabilities that distinguish it from competitors:

1.  **On-Device Processing:** Wherever possible, models run directly on your device (iPhone, iPad, Mac) for instantaneous results and maximum privacy (**on-device AI processing**).
2.  **Personal Context:** The AI analyzes data (like which meeting you are rushing to or which flight confirmation email you just received) to perform proactive, personalized actions.
3.  **System-Wide Integration:** It works natively across core apps—Mail, Notes, Pages, Messages, and Photos—without requiring you to jump into a separate app or tool.

### The Three Pillars of Apple Intelligence

To understand the scope of this new technology, we can categorize the incoming **iPhone AI features** into three distinct pillars:

| Pillar | Key Functionality | Primary Use Case |
