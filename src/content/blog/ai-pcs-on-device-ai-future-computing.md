An AI PC changes that equation by bringing a significant portion of that intelligence home.

This paradigm is often called **edge AI**, which is essentially the practice of processing data near the source of its creation—in this case, right on your laptop. This local approach is the defining characteristic of this new wave of computing.

### The Secret Sauce: The NPU (Neural Processing Unit) Explained

The magic ingredient enabling this shift is a new piece of silicon: the **NPU (Neural Processing Unit)**.

Think of your computer's brain as having three specialized parts:

1.  **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The brilliant generalist. It's the conductor of the orchestra, managing the operating system and running most of the applications you use day-to-day.
2.  **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):** The parallel processing powerhouse. Originally designed for rendering graphics in video games, its architecture is also perfect for handling many tasks at once, which made it the go-to for early AI development.
3.  **NPU (Neural Processing Unit):** The AI specialist. This is a purpose-built accelerator designed from the ground up to handle the specific mathematical operations required by AI algorithms with incredible efficiency. It can perform complex AI tasks using a fraction of the power of a CPU or GPU.
