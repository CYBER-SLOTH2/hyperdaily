![An infographic highlighting the key new features of Llama 3.1, such as its massive context window, vision capabilities, and advanced coding.](/llama-3-1-key-features-infographic-00112.webp)


### Massive Context Window: From 128K to 1 Million Tokens

Perhaps the most significant architectural enhancement is the expansion of the context window. Llama 3.1 can now handle up to **1 million tokens** of context through scalable architecture. A "context window" is the amount of information a model can consider at one time.

**What does this mean in practice?**

*   **Document Analysis:** You can feed the model an entire novel, a lengthy legal contract, or a comprehensive research paper and ask complex questions about its content.
*   **Codebase Comprehension:** **AI for developers** gets a massive boost. A developer can provide an entire software codebase for analysis, debugging, or documentation.
*   **Enhanced Memory:** For **conversational AI**, this means the model can maintain a much longer and more coherent conversation, remembering details from much earlier in the dialogue.

This single feature unlocks a vast range of new and sophisticated **AI applications**, making Llama 3.1 an incredibly versatile tool for knowledge-intensive tasks.

### Advanced Code Generation and Reasoning

Meta has heavily focused on improving Llama 3.1's coding abilities. The model now demonstrates a more profound understanding of programming logic, algorithms, and syntax across various languages. It's not just about writing code snippets; it's about reasoning through complex software development problems, suggesting architectural improvements, and debugging intricate issues. This positions Llama 3.1 as an indispensable assistant for individual developers and entire engineering teams.
